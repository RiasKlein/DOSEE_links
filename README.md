# DOSEE_links
Launcher for tabs to assist in Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition (DOS:EE) sessions.

## Purpose
Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition (DOS:EE) is a large game and it helps to have references for things such as crafting combations or merchant locations.
I noticed that I was opening the same links again and again every time I started a gaming session for this game;
to improve my gaming experience, I decided to create this program which opens the helpful links.

## Current Links (Version 0.1)
* http://www.seth-dehaan.com/divinity_crafting/ :: Crafting Table
* http://divinityoriginalsin.wiki.fextralife.com/Skills :: Skill Descriptions
* http://www.oldgames.sk/docs/Divinity-Original-Sin/merchants.php :: Merchant Locations

## Updates
* More links may be added in the future as they become necessary / very helpful in my gaming sessions.
* Program may become more sophisticated to support increasing number of links. (i.e. categories)

## Disclaimer
I do not own any of the content in the links that this program opens.
